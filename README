This is a presentation I made for my Advanced Systems class in the Fall of
2011. It presents the work published in two papers on extensible operating
systems --

"Exokernel: An Operating System Architecture for Application-Level Resource
Management" by Engler, Kaashoek and O'Toole

"Extensibility, Safety and Performance in the SPIN operating system" by Bershad,
Savage et al.

The JavaScript code and CSS stylesheet is based on that of the HTML5 Rocks HTML5
presentation.
