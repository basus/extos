This is a presentation I made for my Advanced Systems class in the Fall of
2011. It presents the work published in two papers on extensible operating
systems --

["Exokernel: An Operating System Architecture for Application-Level Resource
Management"](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/PDOS-papers.html#Exokernels) by Engler,
Kaashoek and O'Toole

["Extensibility, Safety and Performance in the SPIN operating
system"](http://www-spin.cs.washington.edu/) by Bershad, Savage et al.

The JavaScript code and CSS stylesheet is based on that of the [HTML5 Rocks
slideshow](http://slides.html5rocks.com/). You can [view the
presentation](http://basus.me/presentations/extos) on my website with a modern
web browser.
